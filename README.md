### Hi there 👋
My name's Nathaniel!  

I primarily work in Python and also have experience with C. I received Second Place overall in NSW and First Place nationally for Best AI Project (Middle Division, Years 7-9) in the 2025 Young ICT Explorers Competition. Outside of coding, I enjoy making music and creating conlangs.
