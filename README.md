### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm a **random dud** on the internet who likes fish and coding!

Here are some things to get to know me:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m tinkering on a OrangePi **(because everyone steals the RaspberyPis)** home security system made with **Python**!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Rust!
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you need help with!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started coding at age 7! (only a bit at first)
